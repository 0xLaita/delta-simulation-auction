## Introduction

This repo can be used to help Agents test their solving capabilities for integrating into Paraswap Delta Protocol, or just play around with Agent API.

## Integration Steps

### Step 2: ⚙️ Environment Configuration

- Create `.env`: Copy `.env.template` to `.env`
- Update `.env`: Fill in necessary environment variables

### Step 3: 🏃‍♂️ Running the Auction

- Development Mode: `npm run dev`

### Step 4: 🤝 Settle some Orders!

- If everything is up and running correctly, your Agent should start receiving and executing Delta Orders!

## 👣 Next Steps
